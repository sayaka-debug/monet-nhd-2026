  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Claude Monet (1840–1926) was a French painter who helped change the direction
      of art during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As one of the founders
      of Impressionism, Monet challenged traditional art rules by focusing on
      light, color, and everyday life instead of historical or religious subjects.
      His work played an important role in leading art into the modern era.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Thesis Statement:</strong><br>
      Claude Monet helped found Modernism by breaking away from traditional art
      rules and using his paintings to show how light, nature, and everyday life
      reflected the social and industrial changes of the late 19th and early 20th
      centuries, influencing how artists and audiences view art as a way to
      express ideas and beliefs.

    <h2>Long Before: How did problems in the late 19th century shape Monet?</h2>
    <p>
      During the late 19th century, France experienced industrial growth,
      political instability, and strict control over the arts by traditional
      institutions. Artists were expected to follow strict rules set by the
      French Academy. Monet struggled financially and faced rejection because
      his style did not meet these expectations. These challenges encouraged
      him to experiment and develop a new style that focused on real life rather
      than traditional subjects.

    <h2>Right Before: What inspired Monet to paint?</h2>
    <p>
      Monet was inspired by nature and the effects of light at different times
      of day. New paint technology allowed artists to paint outdoors, which
      helped Monet capture real moments. Japanese artwork also influenced his
      use of color and composition. These inspirations pushed Monet to paint
      modern scenes in new and creative ways.

    <h2>Main Event: How were Monet’s paintings similar to others in the movement?</h2>
    <p>
      Monet’s paintings shared many characteristics with other Impressionist
      artists, including visible brushstrokes, bright colors, and scenes of
      everyday life. Like others in the movement, Monet focused on capturing
      moments rather than perfect details. His repeated studies of the same
      scene under different lighting conditions helped define Impressionism
      and influenced Modernism.

  <section>
    <h2>Right After: How did Monet’s death affect his reputation?</h2>
    <p>
      After Monet’s death in 1926, his work became more widely respected.
      Museums began collecting his paintings, and historians recognized his
      influence on modern art. Monet was no longer viewed as controversial but
      as an important artist who helped change art history.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Long After -->
  <section>
    <h2>Long After: How did Monet change how we view paintings made for a cause?</h2>
    <p>
      Monet showed that art could express personal beliefs and ideas rather
      than follow strict rules. His focus on artistic freedom inspired future
      artists to use art to support causes and express emotions. Because of
      Monet, modern artists feel encouraged to use painting as a form of
      communication and change.

    <h2>Process Paper</h2>
    <p>
      I chose Claude Monet as my National History Day topic because I was
      interested in how art can influence society and reflect historical
      change. I wanted to understand how Monet’s work helped move art away
      from traditional styles and toward Modernism. I began my research by
      reading encyclopedia articles and museum websites to learn about
      Monet’s life and the Impressionist movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose to create a website because it allowed me to organize information
      clearly and include images to support my argument. One challenge I faced
      was making sure my information was accurate and written in my own words.
      I solved this by using multiple reliable sources and summarizing the
      information carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project relates to the National History Day theme because Monet’s
      artwork shows how individuals can challenge traditions and create
      lasting change through creative expression.
